## 2026-04-17 — Vector store singleton bug

### Symptom

End-to-end smoke test: `POST /ingest/text` returned `{"status":"indexed","message":"Successfully indexed 1 chunks."}`. The immediately-following `POST /query` returned `"I could not find relevant information in the indexed documents"` with zero citations and `total_tokens: 0`.

### Hypotheses considered

1. Stale data from earlier Streamlit testing polluting the index.
2. Disk persistence not happening despite the "indexed" response.
3. Ingestion and retrieval using separate in-memory vector store instances.

### Tests run

1. Wiped `faiss_index.idx` and `faiss_metadata.pkl`, retried → same failure. **Ruled out (1).**
2. Checked file size before and after ingest → grew by ~4KB each time (one 1024-dim float32 vector). **Ruled out (2).**
3. Grep'd `get_vector_store()` callers → found ingestion and retrieval each call it once at construction time and cache the result.

### Root cause

`get_vector_store()` in `vectorstore/vector_store.py` was constructing a new `FAISSVectorStore()` on every call with no singleton pattern. `IngestionPipeline.__init__` and `RetrievalExecutor.__init__` each held references to different instances. Writes went to instance A; reads came from instance B. Because FAISS keeps its index in memory and only reads from disk in `__init__`, instance B was permanently stale.

### Fix

Module-level singleton in `vectorstore/vector_store.py`:

- Added `_vector_store_instance: Optional[BaseVectorStore] = None` at module level
- Rewrote `get_vector_store()` to check the cache before constructing
- Added `reset_vector_store()` for test isolation

### Regression tests

Added `tests/integration/test_vectorstore_singleton.py` with four tests. The critical one:

- `test_upserted_chunks_are_searchable_via_second_get_vector_store_call` — upserts via one `get_vector_store()` call, searches via another. Would have failed before the fix.

### Verification

After fix, the same ingest + query cycle returns a correctly grounded answer:

> "The Q3 2024 revenue was $4.2 billion, which represents a 15% growth year-over-year [Source 1]."

Score: 7.6617 (positive, high). Citations match the ingested chunk's `doc_id`.

## 2026-04-17 — Known issue: Self-RAG claim verification parser

### Symptom

With `GENERATION_STRATEGY=self_rag`, queries succeed and return correct answers, but uvicorn logs print:
Claim verification failed: '"supported"'
Claim verification failed: '"supported"'

### Root cause (suspected)

`SelfRAGGenerator._verify_claim()` in `generation/advanced_generation.py` appears to parse the LLM's response assuming a bare string or boolean, but the LLM (gpt-4o-mini) is returning a JSON-quoted string (`"supported"` with literal quotes). The parsing step throws an exception that's caught and logged, and Self-RAG falls back to the initial generation without verification.

### Impact

System degrades gracefully — returns correct answers from initial generation. Verification loop is a no-op.

### Status

Logged, not yet fixed. Low priority because end-user output is correct. To fix: inspect `_verify_claim`'s response parser, add handling for JSON-quoted strings.
